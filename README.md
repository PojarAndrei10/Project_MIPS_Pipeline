# MIPS PIPELINE
The project consists of implementing a MIPS Pipeline architecture using VHDL (Very High-Speed ​​Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language).
MIPS Pipeline is a processor architecture that derives from the MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) architecture. The MIPS architecture was originally developed by MIPS Computer Systems, and the MIPS Pipeline is an extension of it, designed to improve processor performance and efficiency by dividing instruction execution tasks into multiple sequential stages.
The project is designed to illustrate the process of designing and implementing a processor architecture in a hardware simulation environment, as well as the possibilities of optimizing processor performance and efficiency.
In this project, we will explore each stage of the design process and implement each component of the MIPS Pipeline architecture. The implementation of these components will be done using VHDL.
